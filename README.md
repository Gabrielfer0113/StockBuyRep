# StockBuyRep

**StockBuyRep** is a Python program that provides a complete *inventory management and reporting system*. It consists of two distinct areas: the requester area and the buyer area.

The requester's area allows the user to enter information related to materials and their respective quantities. On the other hand, the buyer's area receives this information, organizes it and generates a consolidated report.

In addition, the program allows storage of stock information in a database, including products, quantities and dates. Using this data, the system is able to generate detailed reports that indicate the purchase needs for the month requested by the user in the "requester" area.

The reports generated by the program are in PDF and Excel format, offering a clear and summarized view of essential information for planning and controlling stock. In this way, StockBuyRep simplifies the inventory management process and assists in making strategic decisions, ensuring an adequate supply of products.
